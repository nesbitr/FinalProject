Unit Length Converter
	The app first opens with a menu file, where a user will press the “Start” button to continue. This takes them to the next screen, which has a small text box at the top and buttons at the bottom listing every possible conversion. On this screen, if the user has a value in centimeters and wants to convert it to inches, they can simply enter the value into the text box at the top then press the button with their desired type of conversion. For example, if the user wants to convert 50 inches to centimeters, they can enter 50 as an input and press the “Inches to Centimeters” button. The app will then output the conversion on a new screen, where pressing the ‘Close’ button will take them back to the previous screen listing all possible conversions. To emulate our project, you can open it in android studio as a project and press the play button.
